# Privacy Policy - DarkSpace (D2L Brightspace Dark Mode)

**Last updated:** February 25, 2026

## Data Collection

DarkSpace does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data or browsing activity. The extension makes no network requests and contains no analytics or tracking. All user preferences (dark mode state, document/video dark mode toggles, custom domains) are stored in your browser using `chrome.storage.sync`. If you are signed into Chrome, these preferences may sync across your devices through Google's standard sync feature.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions solely to provide its core functionality:

- **Storage**: Save your preferences locally.
- **Scripting**: Apply dark mode to Brightspace pages by injecting stylesheets and supporting scripts (for handling embedded content, video players, and dynamically loaded elements), and detect whether the current page is a Brightspace site.
- **ActiveTab / Tabs**: Access the current tab to determine whether it is a Brightspace page.
- **Host permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: Brightspace is hosted across numerous institutional domains. The extension runs a lightweight detection check on every page; on non-Brightspace pages, no modifications are made and no data is read or stored.

## Limited Use

DarkSpace's use of information received from Chrome APIs adheres to the [Chrome Web Store Limited Use Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/limited-use/). The extension does not transfer, sell, or use user data for purposes unrelated to its core functionality.

## Data Deletion

DarkSpace stores all data locally in your browser. To delete all extension data, simply uninstall the extension from Chrome. You can also reset your preferences to defaults at any time using the "Reset to Defaults" button in the extension popup.

## Third Parties

No data is sold, transferred, or disclosed to any third party for any purpose. The extension contains no third-party code, libraries, or external services.

## Remote Code

DarkSpace does not load or execute any remote code. All functionality is bundled within the extension.

## Changes

If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in this document with an updated date.
