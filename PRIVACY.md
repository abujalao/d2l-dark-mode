# Privacy Policy - DarkSpace (D2L Brightspace Dark Mode)

**Last updated:** February 23, 2026

## Data Collection

DarkSpace does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data or browsing activity. All user preferences (dark mode state, document/video dark mode toggles, custom domains) are stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.sync` and are never sent to any external server.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions solely to provide its core functionality:

- **storage** — Save your preferences locally.
- **scripting** — Detect whether the current page is a D2L Brightspace site.
- **activeTab / tabs** — Read the active tab's URL to display detection status in the popup.
- **Host permissions (`<all_urls>`)** — Run a lightweight content script that identifies D2L Brightspace pages across any university domain.

## Third Parties

No data is sold, transferred, or disclosed to any third party for any purpose.

## Changes

If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in this document with an updated date.
